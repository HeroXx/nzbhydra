You don't have to follow this template by the letter, just think about what you're trying to achieve ;-) 

## How to do a bug report

* What do you expect to happen? What does happen? 
* Have you searched for this problem? You don't have to answer, just make sure.
* Can the problem be reproduced? How?
* Use a proper title. Describe the problem succinctly, don't just copy and paste the error message.

**Set your log file level to debug, repeat the steps that cause the problem and post the debug info which can be retrieved in the [System / Bugreport section](http://127.0.0.1:5075/nzbhydra/system/bugreport). If other tools are involved post their logs as well.**

The more information you provide up front the higher the chance that I can help you.

## How to request a new feature
* What do you want to happen?
* If not clear, why do you want it?
* Do you think it's something only you need or something that might be popular?
* If need be explain the use case.

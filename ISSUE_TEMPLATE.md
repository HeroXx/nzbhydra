## How to do a bug report

* What do you expect to happen? What does happen? 
* Have you searched for this problem? 
* Can the problem be reproduced? How?
* Use a proper title. Describe the problem succinctly, don't just copy and paste the error message.

**Set your log file level to debug, repeat the steps that cause the problem and post the debug info which can be retrieved in the [System / Bugreport section](http://127.0.0.1:5075/nzbhydra/system/bugreport). If other tools are involved post their logs as well.**

The more information you provide up front the higher the chance that I can help you.

## How to request a new feature
* What do you want to happen?
* Why do you want it?
* Do you think it's something only you need or something that might me popular?
* If need be explain the use case.
* Is it nice to have or a must have? I might disagree but it's still good for me to know what you think.

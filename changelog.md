# NZB Hydra changelog

----------
### 0.0.1a58
Still getting used to writing the change log so I might often forget it for a while.
Fixed a bug where duplicate detection would ironically cause duplicates which caused some weird bugs in the system. Was a pain in the ass to debug and fix.
Added an option to look at this (the changelog) before updating. Will also add a changelog in the about section with the latest changes already included in the running version.
Removed "direct" NZB access type. Programs will always need to contact NZB Hydra to get their NZBs.

### 0.0.1a57
First version with changelog

### 0.0.1a56
Last version without changelog
